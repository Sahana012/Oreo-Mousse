Separate the chocolate cookies from the inside cream filling. Scrape the cream filling into your microwave safe bowl. Then, place the chocolate cookies into a plastic storage bag.

Seal the plastic storage bag and crush to cookies until they are finely ground.

Microwave the reamining cream for about 90 seconds and give it a light stir.

In a mixing bowl, using an electric mixer with whisk attachment, start whipping your cream. Gradually, add in powdered sugar and the filling from the cookies. Keep whipping until stiff peaks form.

Fold in the crushed cookie crumbs. Cover your mousse and refrigerate for just 30 minutes before serving. If you really can’t wait the 30 minutes, just go ahead and dig in. It’s still yummy!

Serve it with a few extra cookies or additional crumbs

Enjoy!
